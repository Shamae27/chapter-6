# USING COMMON WIDGETS

using common widgets in Flutter is essential for efficient and consistent app development. These widgets, such as Container, Text, Row, Column, and ListView, provide a solid foundation for creating both simple and complex user interfaces. They are versatile, well-optimized, and designed to handle most UI needs without requiring custom implementations

Leveraging these widgets not only saves time but also ensures that the app adheres to best practices, making it easier to maintain and scale. Additionally, since these widgets are widely used, they are well-documented and supported, which simplifies debugging and enhances collaboration within development teams.
